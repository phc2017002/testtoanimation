00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
Welcome to this comprehensive exploration of multivariate calculus. Multivariate

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:12,292
calculus extends the concepts of single-variable calculus to functions

3
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:17,001
of multiple variables, opening up a world of applications

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,380
in physics, engineering, economics, and data science.

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:27,227
In this presentation, we will explore partial derivatives, gradient vectors,

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:33,474
directional derivatives, and multiple integrals. We will visualize these concepts

7
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:39,026
in three-dimensional space to build intuition about how functions behave

8
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,342
when they depend on more than one variable.

9
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:49,800
Let's begin by understanding the transition from single-variable to multivariable

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,389
functions. In single-variable calculus, we studied functions like f of

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,221
x, which maps a single input to a single output.

12
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:04,554
In multivariate calculus, we extend this to functions of two

13
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:08,113
or more variables, such as f of x and y.

14
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:12,650
For example, the function z equals x squared plus y

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,344
squared creates a paraboloid surface in three-dimensional space.

16
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:24,326
Here is an example of a multivariable function. The function f

17
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:28,353
of x comma y equals x squared plus y squared takes

18
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:34,957
two inputs and produces one output, forming a beautiful three-dimensional surface.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,311
Now let's explore partial derivatives, one of the fundamental concepts

20
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:45,983
in multivariate calculus. When we have a function of multiple

21
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:50,884
variables, we can take derivatives with respect to each variable

22
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:55,174
individually, treating all other variables as constants.

23
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:00,651
The partial derivative of f with respect to x is denoted by del

24
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,526
f del x or f sub x. To compute it, we differentiate with

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:11,185
respect to x while treating y as a constant. For our example, the

26
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:16,670
partial derivative with respect to x is two x y plus y squared.

27
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:21,836
Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y treats x as

28
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:27,416
a constant. For our function, the partial derivative with respect to

29
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:32,175
y equals x squared plus two x y. These partial derivatives

30
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:36,278
tell us how the function changes as we move in the

31
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:39,970
x direction or the y direction independently.

32
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:47,086
Let's visualize what partial derivatives mean geometrically. Consider the surface

33
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:51,393
z equals x squared plus y squared. The partial derivative

34
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:55,398
with respect to x represents the slope of the surface

35
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,949
in the x direction, which we can visualize as a

36
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,878
slice through the surface parallel to the x-z plane.

37
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:07,775
When we fix y equals one and vary x, we get a cross-section of

38
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:13,318
the surface. The partial derivative del z del x at this point gives us

39
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:19,494
the slope of this curve. This represents the instantaneous rate of change of z

40
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:24,562
as we move in the positive x direction while keeping y constant.

41
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,928
The gradient is a vector that combines all the partial derivatives of

42
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:35,059
a function. For a function f of x and y, the gradient

43
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,722
is denoted as del f or grad f, and it points in

44
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,854
the direction of the steepest ascent of the function.

45
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,480
For our example function f of x comma y equals x squared

46
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,096
plus y squared, we first compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative

47
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:58,975
with respect to x is two x, and the partial derivative with

48
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:03,936
respect to y is two y. Therefore, the gradient vector is the

49
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,162
vector with components two x and two y.

50
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:12,525
The gradient vector has a beautiful geometric interpretation. At any point

51
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,019
on the surface, the gradient points in the direction where the

52
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:22,164
function increases most rapidly. The magnitude of the gradient tells us

53
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:25,354
how steep the function is in that direction.

54
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:31,205
Let's visualize the gradient vector field. Each arrow represents the

55
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:35,772
gradient at that point, showing both the direction and magnitude

56
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:40,195
of the steepest increase. Notice how the arrows point radially

57
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:44,690
outward from the origin, which makes sense because our function

58
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,402
grows as we move away from the center.

59
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:53,389
While partial derivatives tell us the rate of change in the coordinate

60
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:59,106
directions, directional derivatives tell us the rate of change in any direction.

61
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:03,751
The directional derivative of f in the direction of a unit vector

62
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:07,539
u is given by the dot product of the gradient with u.

63
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,592
Let's work through an example. Suppose we have the function f of

64
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,935
x comma y equals x squared minus y squared, and we want

65
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:21,989
to find the directional derivative at the point one comma one in

66
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:26,726
the direction of the vector one comma one. First, we need to

67
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,227
normalize this direction vector to make it a unit vector.

68
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:36,975
Next, we compute the gradient of f. The partial derivative with respect to

69
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:41,015
x is two x, and with respect to y is negative two y.

70
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:46,297
At the point one comma one, the gradient equals the vector two comma

71
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:51,890
negative two. Finally, we take the dot product of this gradient with our

72
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,105
unit vector to get the directional derivative, which equals zero. This means the

73
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:03,387
function is not changing in this particular direction at this point.

74
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:09,876
Let's continue our calculation. The gradient at point one comma one is

75
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:14,816
two comma negative two. Now we compute the dot product with our

76
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,051
unit vector one over root two comma one over root two.

77
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:24,803
Just as we extend derivatives to multiple dimensions, we also

78
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:30,179
extend integration. Double integrals and triple integrals allow us to

79
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,568
integrate functions over regions in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space. A

80
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,619
double integral computes the volume under a surface.

81
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,068
We can evaluate double integrals as iterated integrals, integrating first

82
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:49,949
with respect to one variable and then the other. The

83
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:54,279
order of integration matters when the bounds depend on the

84
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,563
variables. Let's look at a concrete example.

85
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:03,135
Let's compute the double integral of the function f of x

86
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:07,870
comma y equals x times y over the rectangular region where

87
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,463
x goes from zero to two and y goes from zero

88
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:15,627
to one. We can set this up as an iterated integral.

89
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:21,795
First, we integrate with respect to y, treating x as a constant. The

90
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:27,238
antiderivative of x y with respect to y is x times y squared

91
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:32,499
over two. Evaluating from zero to one gives us x over two.

92
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,710
Now we integrate with respect to x. The antiderivative of x over

93
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,677
two is x squared over four. Evaluating from zero to two gives

94
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:47,643
us four over four, which equals one. So the volume under this

95
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:52,203
surface over the given region is exactly one cubic unit.

96
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:58,837
Let's visualize what a double integral represents geometrically. We'll look

97
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,443
at the function z equals one plus x squared plus

98
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:07,101
y squared over a rectangular region. The double integral gives

99
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:11,083
us the volume between this surface and the x-y plane.

100
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,395
The volume we're computing is the space between this curved surface and

101
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:21,046
the flat x-y plane below it. We can approximate this volume by

102
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:26,896
dividing the region into small rectangles, computing the volume of thin boxes,

103
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:31,922
and summing them up. As we make the rectangles smaller and smaller,

104
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:36,198
we approach the exact value given by the double integral.

105
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:41,606
The chain rule extends to multivariable calculus as well. When

106
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:45,456
we have a composition of functions, we need to account

107
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:49,805
for all the paths through which one variable affects another.

108
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:54,154
This is where the multivariable chain rule becomes essential.

109
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:58,263
Suppose z is a function of x and y, and both x and

110
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:03,112
y are functions of t. To find how z changes with respect to

111
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:08,125
t, we use the chain rule. The derivative of z with respect to

112
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:13,385
t equals the partial derivative of z with respect to x times the

113
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:18,891
derivative of x with respect to t, plus the partial derivative of z

114
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,986
with respect to y times the derivative of y with respect to t.

115
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:31,085
Let's work through an example. Suppose z equals x squared plus y squared, where

116
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:36,027
x equals cosine of t and y equals sine of t. We want to

117
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:41,868
find d z d t. First, we compute the partial derivatives of z with

118
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:47,170
respect to x and y, which are two x and two y respectively.

119
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:54,388
Now we apply the chain rule. We substitute our expressions for the partial

120
00:09:54,488 --> 00:10:00,018
derivatives and the derivatives of x and y. This gives us two times

121
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:05,479
cosine t times negative sine t plus two times sine t times cosine

122
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:11,109
t. When we simplify, the two terms cancel out, giving us zero. This

123
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:17,075
makes sense geometrically because x equals cosine t and y equals sine t

124
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:22,200
traces out a circle of radius one, so z equals x squared plus

125
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,250
y squared is constantly equal to one, and its derivative is indeed zero.

126
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,775
Multivariate calculus has countless applications across science and engineering. Let's

127
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,099
explore a few important ones. In optimization, we use the

128
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,576
gradient to find maximum and minimum values of functions of

129
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:49,962
multiple variables, which is crucial in machine learning and economics.

130
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,099
In physics, multivariate calculus describes electromagnetic fields, fluid flow,

131
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,302
and heat transfer. The gradient tells us the direction

132
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:05,517
of maximum temperature increase, while divergence and curl describe

133
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:09,642
how vector fields flow and rotate. In engineering, we

134
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:15,013
use partial differential equations to model everything from vibrating

135
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:18,126
strings to air flow over aircraft wings.

136
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:22,589
In data science and machine learning, gradient descent uses

137
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:26,303
the gradient to iteratively find the minimum of a

138
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:30,395
loss function, which is how neural networks learn from

139
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:35,474
data. Statistical models often involve functions of many variables,

140
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:40,173
requiring multivariate calculus for analysis and optimization.

141
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:45,776
Let's recap what we've learned about multivariate calculus. We

142
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:50,898
explored partial derivatives, which measure how functions change with

143
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:55,649
respect to individual variables. We studied the gradient vector,

144
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:59,510
which points in the direction of steepest ascent and

145
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,261
combines all partial derivatives into a single geometric object.

146
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:09,511
We learned about directional derivatives, which extend the concept to

147
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,164
any direction in space, and we saw how the chain

148
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:18,870
rule generalizes to handle compositions of multivariable functions. We also

149
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,045
explored double and triple integrals for computing volumes and other

150
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:27,469
quantities over regions in higher dimensions.

151
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:33,782
Multivariate calculus is a powerful tool that extends single-variable

152
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:38,094
calculus to the multi-dimensional world we live in. From

153
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:44,100
optimizing complex systems to understanding physical phenomena, these concepts

154
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,414
are fundamental to modern science, engineering, and technology. Thank

155
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:53,957
you for watching this exploration of multivariate calculus!
