00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
Welcome to this comprehensive exploration of multivariate calculus. Multivariate

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:12,292
calculus extends the concepts of single-variable calculus to functions

3
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:17,001
of multiple variables, opening up a world of applications

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,380
in physics, engineering, economics, and data science.

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:27,227
In this presentation, we will explore partial derivatives, gradient vectors,

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:33,474
directional derivatives, and multiple integrals. We will visualize these concepts

7
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:39,026
in three-dimensional space to build intuition about how functions behave

8
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,342
when they depend on more than one variable.

9
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:49,800
Let's begin by understanding the transition from single-variable to multivariable

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,389
functions. In single-variable calculus, we studied functions like f of

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,221
x, which maps a single input to a single output.

12
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:04,554
In multivariate calculus, we extend this to functions of two

13
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:08,113
or more variables, such as f of x and y.

14
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:12,650
For example, the function z equals x squared plus y

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,344
squared creates a paraboloid surface in three-dimensional space.

16
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:24,326
Here is an example of a multivariable function. The function f

17
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:28,353
of x comma y equals x squared plus y squared takes

18
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:34,957
two inputs and produces one output, forming a beautiful three-dimensional surface.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,311
Now let's explore partial derivatives, one of the fundamental concepts

20
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:45,983
in multivariate calculus. When we have a function of multiple

21
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:50,884
variables, we can take derivatives with respect to each variable

22
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:55,174
individually, treating all other variables as constants.

23
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:00,651
The partial derivative of f with respect to x is denoted by del

24
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,526
f del x or f sub x. To compute it, we differentiate with

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:11,185
respect to x while treating y as a constant. For our example, the

26
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:16,670
partial derivative with respect to x is two x y plus y squared.

27
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:21,836
Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y treats x as

28
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:27,416
a constant. For our function, the partial derivative with respect to

29
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:32,175
y equals x squared plus two x y. These partial derivatives

30
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:36,278
tell us how the function changes as we move in the

31
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:39,970
x direction or the y direction independently.

32
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:47,086
Let's visualize what partial derivatives mean geometrically. Consider the surface

33
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:51,393
z equals x squared plus y squared. The partial derivative

34
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:55,398
with respect to x represents the slope of the surface

35
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,949
in the x direction, which we can visualize as a

36
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,878
slice through the surface parallel to the x-z plane.

37
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:07,775
When we fix y equals one and vary x, we get a cross-section of

38
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:13,318
the surface. The partial derivative del z del x at this point gives us

39
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:19,494
the slope of this curve. This represents the instantaneous rate of change of z

40
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:24,562
as we move in the positive x direction while keeping y constant.

41
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,928
The gradient is a vector that combines all the partial derivatives of

42
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:35,059
a function. For a function f of x and y, the gradient

43
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,722
is denoted as del f or grad f, and it points in

44
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,854
the direction of the steepest ascent of the function.

45
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,480
For our example function f of x comma y equals x squared

46
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,096
plus y squared, we first compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative

47
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:58,975
with respect to x is two x, and the partial derivative with

48
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:03,936
respect to y is two y. Therefore, the gradient vector is the

49
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,162
vector with components two x and two y.

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,513
The gradient vector has a beautiful geometric interpretation. At any point

51
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:17,007
on the surface, the gradient points in the direction where the

52
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:22,152
function increases most rapidly. The magnitude of the gradient tells us

53
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:25,342
how steep the function is in that direction.

54
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:31,185
Let's visualize the gradient vector field. Each arrow represents the

55
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:35,751
gradient at that point, showing both the direction and magnitude

56
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:40,175
of the steepest increase. Notice how the arrows point radially

57
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:44,670
outward from the origin, which makes sense because our function

58
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,381
grows as we move away from the center.

59
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:53,369
While partial derivatives tell us the rate of change in the coordinate

60
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:59,086
directions, directional derivatives tell us the rate of change in any direction.

61
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:03,731
The directional derivative of f in the direction of a unit vector

62
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:07,518
u is given by the dot product of the gradient with u.

63
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:12,570
Let's work through an example. Suppose we have the function f of

64
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,912
x comma y equals x squared minus y squared, and we want

65
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:21,966
to find the directional derivative at the point one comma one in

66
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:26,703
the direction of the vector one comma one. First, we need to

67
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:31,204
normalize this direction vector to make it a unit vector.

68
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,948
Next, we compute the gradient of f. The partial derivative with respect to

69
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:40,987
x is two x, and with respect to y is negative two y.

70
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:46,270
At the point one comma one, the gradient equals the vector two comma

71
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,863
negative two. Finally, we take the dot product of this gradient with our

72
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:58,077
unit vector to get the directional derivative, which equals zero. This means the

73
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:03,360
function is not changing in this particular direction at this point.

74
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,839
Let's continue our calculation. The gradient at point one comma one is

75
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,779
two comma negative two. Now we compute the dot product with our

76
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,014
unit vector one over root two comma one over root two.

77
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,752
Just as we extend derivatives to multiple dimensions, we also

78
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:30,128
extend integration. Double integrals and triple integrals allow us to

79
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:36,516
integrate functions over regions in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space. A

80
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:40,568
double integral computes the volume under a surface.

81
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:46,015
We can evaluate double integrals as iterated integrals, integrating first

82
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:49,897
with respect to one variable and then the other. The

83
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:54,226
order of integration matters when the bounds depend on the

84
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,510
variables. Let's look at a concrete example.

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,072
Let's compute the double integral of the function f of x

86
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,807
comma y equals x times y over the rectangular region where

87
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:11,400
x goes from zero to two and y goes from zero

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,564
to one. We can set this up as an iterated integral.

89
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,718
First, we integrate with respect to y, treating x as a constant. The

90
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:27,160
antiderivative of x y with respect to y is x times y squared

91
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,422
over two. Evaluating from zero to one gives us x over two.

92
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:37,627
Now we integrate with respect to x. The antiderivative of x over

93
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,594
two is x squared over four. Evaluating from zero to two gives

94
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:47,561
us four over four, which equals one. So the volume under this

95
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:52,120
surface over the given region is exactly one cubic unit.

96
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:58,751
Let's visualize what a double integral represents geometrically. We'll look

97
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:02,357
at the function z equals one plus x squared plus

98
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:07,014
y squared over a rectangular region. The double integral gives

99
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:10,996
us the volume between this surface and the x-y plane.

100
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:16,308
The volume we're computing is the space between this curved surface and

101
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:20,959
the flat x-y plane below it. We can approximate this volume by

102
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:26,810
dividing the region into small rectangles, computing the volume of thin boxes,

103
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,835
and summing them up. As we make the rectangles smaller and smaller,

104
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:36,111
we approach the exact value given by the double integral.

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,520
The chain rule extends to multivariable calculus as well. When

106
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,370
we have a composition of functions, we need to account

107
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,719
for all the paths through which one variable affects another.

108
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:54,068
This is where the multivariable chain rule becomes essential.

109
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,175
Suppose z is a function of x and y, and both x and

110
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:03,024
y are functions of t. To find how z changes with respect to

111
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:08,037
t, we use the chain rule. The derivative of z with respect to

112
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:13,297
t equals the partial derivative of z with respect to x times the

113
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:18,803
derivative of x with respect to t, plus the partial derivative of z

114
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:23,898
with respect to y times the derivative of y with respect to t.

115
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:30,982
Let's work through an example. Suppose z equals x squared plus y squared, where

116
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:35,924
x equals cosine of t and y equals sine of t. We want to

117
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:41,765
find d z d t. First, we compute the partial derivatives of z with

118
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:47,067
respect to x and y, which are two x and two y respectively.

119
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:54,284
Now we apply the chain rule. We substitute our expressions for the partial

120
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:59,914
derivatives and the derivatives of x and y. This gives us two times

121
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:05,375
cosine t times negative sine t plus two times sine t times cosine

122
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:11,005
t. When we simplify, the two terms cancel out, giving us zero. This

123
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:16,971
makes sense geometrically because x equals cosine t and y equals sine t

124
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:22,096
traces out a circle of radius one, so z equals x squared plus

125
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:28,146
y squared is constantly equal to one, and its derivative is indeed zero.

126
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:35,657
Multivariate calculus has countless applications across science and engineering. Let's

127
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:39,982
explore a few important ones. In optimization, we use the

128
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:44,458
gradient to find maximum and minimum values of functions of

129
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:49,845
multiple variables, which is crucial in machine learning and economics.

130
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:55,982
In physics, multivariate calculus describes electromagnetic fields, fluid flow,

131
00:10:56,082 --> 00:11:00,185
and heat transfer. The gradient tells us the direction

132
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,400
of maximum temperature increase, while divergence and curl describe

133
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,525
how vector fields flow and rotate. In engineering, we

134
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:14,895
use partial differential equations to model everything from vibrating

135
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:18,009
strings to air flow over aircraft wings.

136
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,471
In data science and machine learning, gradient descent uses

137
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:26,185
the gradient to iteratively find the minimum of a

138
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:30,278
loss function, which is how neural networks learn from

139
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:35,356
data. Statistical models often involve functions of many variables,

140
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:40,056
requiring multivariate calculus for analysis and optimization.

141
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,652
Let's recap what we've learned about multivariate calculus. We

142
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:50,775
explored partial derivatives, which measure how functions change with

143
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:55,526
respect to individual variables. We studied the gradient vector,

144
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:59,386
which points in the direction of steepest ascent and

145
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:04,138
combines all partial derivatives into a single geometric object.

146
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:09,383
We learned about directional derivatives, which extend the concept to

147
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:13,036
any direction in space, and we saw how the chain

148
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:18,742
rule generalizes to handle compositions of multivariable functions. We also

149
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:23,917
explored double and triple integrals for computing volumes and other

150
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:27,341
quantities over regions in higher dimensions.

151
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:33,646
Multivariate calculus is a powerful tool that extends single-variable

152
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:37,958
calculus to the multi-dimensional world we live in. From

153
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:43,964
optimizing complex systems to understanding physical phenomena, these concepts

154
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:49,278
are fundamental to modern science, engineering, and technology. Thank

155
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:53,821
you for watching this exploration of multivariate calculus!
