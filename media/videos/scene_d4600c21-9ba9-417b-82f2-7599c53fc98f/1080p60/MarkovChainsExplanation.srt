00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,819
Welcome to this comprehensive exploration of Markov Chains, one

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,113
of the most powerful concepts in probability theory and

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:15,047
stochastic processes. Markov Chains are mathematical systems that transition

4
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:19,732
from one state to another according to certain probabilistic

5
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:24,963
rules. They have profound applications across many fields including

6
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:28,868
physics, economics, biology, and computer science.

7
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:32,599
Today we will explore the fundamental properties of

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,722
Markov Chains, understand their mathematical foundations, work through

9
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,893
detailed examples, and discover how they model real-world

10
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:46,650
phenomena from weather prediction to Google's PageRank algorithm.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,586
The concept of Markov Chains was introduced by the

12
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:56,466
Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in nineteen oh six. Markov

13
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:01,347
was studying the statistical properties of letter sequences in

14
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:07,330
Russian literature, particularly in Alexander Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin.

15
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:13,189
Markov's groundbreaking insight was that in certain random processes, the future

16
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:17,593
state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence

17
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:22,291
of events that preceded it. This property, now called the Markov

18
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:27,650
property or memorylessness, became the foundation for an entire branch of

19
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,037
mathematics. His work revolutionized our understanding of stochastic processes and laid

20
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,340
the groundwork for modern probability theory.

21
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:43,342
Let us now formally define a Markov Chain. A Markov Chain is a

22
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:49,967
stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. We denote the state at time

23
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:54,168
n as X sub n, which takes values in a state space S.

24
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:59,501
The state space can be finite or infinite, discrete or continuous.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,047
The key defining property is that the conditional probability of the next

26
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:11,430
state, given all previous states, depends only on the current state. Mathematically,

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,521
this means that the probability of transitioning to state j at time

28
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,168
n plus one, given that we are in state i at time

29
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:23,740
n, is independent of how we arrived at state i.

30
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:28,794
We denote the transition probability from state i to state j as

31
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:33,212
p sub i j. If these probabilities do not depend on time

32
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:40,200
n, we call the Markov Chain time-homogeneous or stationary. Most practical applications

33
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,261
involve stationary Markov Chains, which we will focus on today.

34
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,890
The transition probabilities can be organized into a transition matrix P,

35
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,216
where each entry p sub i j represents the probability of

36
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,925
moving from state i to state j. This matrix is a

37
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:06,338
powerful tool for analyzing Markov Chains and computing future state probabilities.

38
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:11,793
The transition matrix has two crucial properties. First, all entries

39
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:17,736
are non-negative since they represent probabilities. Second, each row must

40
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:21,831
sum to one, because from any given state, the chain

41
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:26,569
must transition to some state, possibly staying in the same

42
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:29,781
state. This makes P a stochastic matrix.

43
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:35,702
A remarkable property of transition matrices is that the n-step transition

44
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:40,836
probabilities, that is, the probability of going from state i to

45
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:45,007
state j in exactly n steps, are given by the entries

46
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:48,937
of P raised to the power n. This follows from the

47
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:53,670
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, which we will explore shortly.

48
00:03:54,766 --> 00:04:00,086
Let us illustrate these concepts with a classic example: a simple weather

49
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:04,837
model. Suppose we classify each day as either sunny or rainy. If

50
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:09,737
today is sunny, there is a seventy percent chance tomorrow will be

51
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:14,191
sunny and a thirty percent chance it will be rainy. If today

52
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,943
is rainy, there is a forty percent chance tomorrow will be sunny

53
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,506
and a sixty percent chance it will remain rainy.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,887
We can represent this weather model as a transition matrix.

55
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:31,200
The first row corresponds to sunny weather, and the second

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,959
row to rainy weather. The columns represent the probabilities of

57
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:41,313
transitioning to sunny or rainy conditions respectively. Notice how each

58
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:45,924
row sums to one, satisfying our stochastic matrix requirement.

59
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:52,292
Now let's answer a practical question: if today is sunny, what is the

60
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:57,201
probability that it will be sunny two days from now? We need to

61
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:03,356
compute P squared. We can calculate this by matrix multiplication. The entry in

62
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:08,108
the first row, first column of P squared gives us our answer.

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,893
Markov Chains can be beautifully visualized using state diagrams. Each state

64
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:19,468
is represented by a circle or node, and arrows between nodes

65
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:26,100
show possible transitions. The arrow labels display the transition probabilities. Let's

66
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,836
create the state diagram for our weather example.

67
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:34,412
Now we add the transition arrows. The curved arrow from sunny

68
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:39,217
to rainy shows the zero point three probability of rain tomorrow

69
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:43,947
given sun today. Similarly, the arrow from rainy to sunny shows

70
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:49,652
the zero point four probability. The self-loops represent the probability of

71
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:54,307
staying in the same state. Notice that all arrows leaving each

72
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:57,385
state have probabilities that sum to one.

73
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:04,734
A fundamental theorem in Markov Chain theory is the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

74
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:11,245
This equation allows us to compute multi-step transition probabilities by breaking

75
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:16,246
them down into smaller steps. It states that the probability of

76
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:19,501
going from state i to state k in m plus n

77
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:24,106
steps equals the sum over all intermediate states j of the

78
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:28,076
probability of going from i to j in m steps, times

79
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,887
the probability of going from j to k in n steps.

80
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:37,480
This equation has profound implications. In matrix notation, it simply

81
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,678
says that P to the power m plus n equals

82
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:43,636
P to the power m times P to the power

83
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,834
n. This is why we can compute multi-step transition probabilities

84
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:55,870
by matrix exponentiation. The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is the mathematical foundation

85
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,067
that makes Markov Chains tractable and computationally efficient.

86
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,881
Let's visualize this concept. Imagine we want to go from state

87
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:09,299
A to state C in two steps. We can go through

88
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:15,356
intermediate state B or through state D. The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation tells

89
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:19,861
us to sum the probabilities of all possible paths. This is

90
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:26,074
exactly what matrix multiplication does automatically when we compute P squared.

91
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,393
One of the most important questions in Markov Chain theory

92
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,272
is: what happens in the long run? Many Markov Chains

93
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:40,792
have a steady-state distribution, also called a stationary distribution or

94
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:46,536
equilibrium distribution. This is a probability distribution over states that

95
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,818
remains unchanged after one transition step.

96
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:54,783
For our weather example, we can find the steady state by solving

97
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:59,827
the equation pi times P equals pi, subject to the constraint that

98
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:04,328
the probabilities sum to one. Let pi sub s be the long-run

99
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:09,760
probability of sunny weather, and pi sub r be the long-run probability

100
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,416
of rainy weather. We need to solve this system of equations.

101
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:19,287
Solving this system, we find that pi sub s equals four sevenths,

102
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:24,310
approximately zero point five seven one, and pi sub r equals three

103
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,789
sevenths, approximately zero point four two nine. This means that in the

104
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,508
long run, regardless of whether we start with a sunny or rainy

105
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:39,302
day, the weather will be sunny about fifty seven percent of the

106
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:43,944
time and rainy about forty three percent of the time. This is

107
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:49,576
a remarkable result showing that the system forgets its initial condition.

108
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:57,097
Markov Chains have extraordinary applications across diverse fields. In finance,

109
00:08:57,197 --> 00:09:01,996
they model stock prices and credit ratings. In biology, they

110
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:08,282
describe population dynamics and genetic evolution. In computer science, they

111
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,936
power the PageRank algorithm that Google uses to rank web

112
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:18,814
pages. In physics, they model particle motion and thermodynamic systems.

113
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,096
Let's briefly explore the PageRank algorithm. Imagine the internet as

114
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,010
a giant Markov Chain where each webpage is a state,

115
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,999
and hyperlinks are transitions. A random surfer clicks links with

116
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:37,374
probability d, or jumps to a random page with probability

117
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:42,901
one minus d. The steady-state distribution gives each page's importance.

118
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:48,120
Pages with high steady-state probability are ranked higher in search

119
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,112
results. This simple idea revolutionized web search.

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,528
We have explored the fascinating world of Markov Chains,

121
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:02,035
from their historical origins with Andrey Markov to their

122
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:07,017
modern applications in technology and science. We learned about

123
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:13,185
the Markov property, transition matrices, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

124
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:18,642
We computed steady-state distributions and saw how these mathematical

125
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,252
tools model real-world phenomena.

126
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,288
The beauty of Markov Chains lies in their simplicity and

127
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:29,976
power. With just the memoryless property and some linear algebra,

128
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:34,952
we can model incredibly complex systems and make precise predictions.

129
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,433
Whether you're analyzing web traffic, modeling weather patterns, or studying

130
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:46,347
molecular dynamics, Markov Chains provide an elegant mathematical framework. Thank

00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:50,386
you for joining this journey through probability theory.

132
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,350
Thank you for watching. Keep exploring the

133
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,671
wonderful world of mathematics and probability!
