Welcome! Today we will explore the Bubble Sort algorithm,

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:08,756
one of the simplest sorting algorithms in computer science.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,171
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:19,326
elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,595
Let's visualize this with an example. Here

6
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,484
we have an unsorted array of numbers.

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,510
We start by comparing the first two elements. Five

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,491
is greater than two, so we swap them.

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,675
Now we compare five and eight. They are

10
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,867
already in order, so no swap is needed.

11
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:45,002
Next, eight and one. Eight is larger, so we swap them.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,234
Finally, eight and nine are in order. The

13
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,312
largest element has bubbled to the end.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,581
We repeat this process, each time the next

15
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:58,332
largest element bubbles to its correct position.

16
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,895
Now let's analyze the time complexity. Bubble sort has a

17
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:08,556
worst-case and average time complexity of O of n squared.

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,331
However, in the best case, when the array is

19
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:15,942
already sorted, it only takes O of n time.

20
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,982
The space complexity is O of 1, as it

21
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:23,349
only requires a constant amount of additional memory.

22
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:29,750
In conclusion, while Bubble Sort is simple to understand and implement,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,557
it is not efficient for large datasets. Thank you for watching!
